# bevy-rust-gpu

Support code for compiling and using `rust-gpu` shaders for `bevy`.

## `bevy-app` Workspace

Stable rust workspace housing our `bevy` app.

`Cargo.toml` contains custom `[profile.dev]` and `[profile.dev.package."*"]` sections for fast compiles.

`cargo run` after building the `rust-gpu` workspace to preview the generated shader.

### `viewer` Crate

Bevy binary crate, loads an example scene that renders a side-by-side comparison of WGSL and Rust PBR materials.

Uses the workspace root as its asset folder, and hot-reloads `rust-gpu/target/spirv-builder/spirv-unknown-spv1.5/release/deps/shader.spv` via AssetServer.

The shader is loaded into a custom `RustGpuMaterial` material, which composes `StandardMaterial` with type-level entrypoint overrides and value-level shader overrides.

Shader permutations are selected by using the `RustGpuEntryPoint` trait to translate shader defs into an entrypoint name.

In addition, the `shader.spv.json` metadata generated by `rust-gpu` can be loaded as a resource and provided to `RustGpuMaterial` to enable runtime entrypoint validation.

This will defer material loading until metadata is available, and prevent bevy from panicking in case of a missing entrypoint. A warning will be printed, and the material will fall back to the default vertex / fragment shader.

`WgpuLimits::max_storage_buffers_per_shader_stage` is forced to 0 via `WgpuSettings` to ensure a `NO_STORAGE_BUFFER_SUPPORT` environment.

#### Custom Bevy

`viewer` depends on [Shfty/bevy:remove-spv-defs](https://github.com/Shfty/bevy), which is the `v0.9.1` tag patched to prevent rejection of SPIR-V modules when shader defs are present.

## `rust-gpu` Workspace

Nightly rust workspace housing `rust-gpu` crates.

`Cargo.toml` contains the `rust-gpu`-recommended `[profile.*.build-override]` settings to ensure fast shader compiles,

`rust-toolchain` contains the necessary toolchain specification for `rust-gpu`.

`.cargo/config.toml` contains environment variables overriding the permutation file path used to compile `bevy-pbr-rust`.

`cargo run --release "crates/shader"` to produce `target/spirv-builder/spirv-unknown-spv1.5/release/deps/shader.spv`.

`cargo run --release "crates/shader" -w ./crates -w ../bevy-app/crates/viewer` to watch both workspaces and recompile on change.

### `shader`

Project-level `rust-gpu` shader crate. Pulls in `bevy-pbr-rust` to expose its entrypoints.

Entrypoints are exported relative to their containing crate using rust module path syntax,
i.e. `mesh::vertex`, `pbr::fragment`.
